## Data Structures

1. **DLB Trie**

   Uses provided DLB node class to store the data of each character in input strings, score of the words, if the string end with a node is a valid word, and the node's sibling and child.

2. **ArrayList**

   Stores Suggestion objects which are pairs of valid words (keys) in the trie and its score indicating how many times it has been retrieved.

3. **StringBuilder**

   Store the string concatenated by the characters from the top of the trie following its child/sibling.

## Algorithms

### Task 1 - DLB Insert and Score Maintenance

1. **Insert**

   In insert, we have a position variable (an int) to help track where we are in the word we want to insert. And we insert one character at a time by using this position int as an index to get the char at that index in the word.

   - If there is no node in the place we want to insert:
     - create a new node and assign its data to the corresponding character in the word
     - check if we have reached the end of the word:
       - If yes, we set the isWord true in the node containing the last character of the word
       - If not, we recurse on the current node's child and increment the position by 1 so we can insert the next char
   - If there is a node in the place we want to insert:
     - we check if the node's data is the same as the char we want to  insert
       - If yes, check if we have reached the end of the word:
         - If yes, we set the isWord true in the node containing the last character of the word
         - If not, we recurse on the current node's child and increment the position by 1 so we can insert the next char
       -  If not, we recurse on the current node's sibling. At this point, we have not inserted the character, so we do not increment position.

2. **Score Maintenance**

   Use the given getNode() method which returns the node containing the last character of the word and get its returned node. Then we increment its score field by 1. If no such node is found, we simply print out a message indicting that and do not increment the score.

   When we try to get the score of a specific word, we take a similar approach: use getNode() to get the node containing the last character of the word. And we return its score field.

### Task 2 - Retrieving Word Suggestions

- Get the node (let's call it "start" here) containing the last character of the prefix we pass in

  - if the prefix is a word itself, we store the Suggestion containing the prefix and its score into our word prediction ArrayList

- We now want to get all words starting with the prefix. We start our search on the start node's child.

  -------------------------------

  ​	If the node we are currently searching is null, simply return.

  ​	If not:

  - append the node's data to our prefix, so it's a new prefix now
  - check that if our new prefix is a valid word now:
    - if yes, we add the Suggestion containing the new prefix and its score to our word prediction ArrayList
  - if the current node has a child
    - recurse on the current node's child, using our new prefix as the searching prefix
  - if the current node has a sibling
    - get the last index of the current node's data
    - get the substring of the prefix from its beginning to one character before the last index
    - recurse on the current node's sibling, using the substring as the searching prefix

  ---------------------------------------------

## Coding/Debugging Issue (fixed)

When recusing on the searchWord method, each time I added a new Suggestion to my word prediction ArrayList, the old values in the ArrayList got overwritten by the newly added Suggestion.

I fixed this issue by declare an empty StringBuilder at the beginning of the method and append the old prefix I passed in to the empty StringBuilder. So I do not pass in the same prefix object for every recursion.

## Run-time Analysis

Let's assume that:

c    -    Number of words in the dictionary

w   -    Number of characters in a word and/or prefix

R    -    The alphabet size

s    -    Number of matching word suggestions
